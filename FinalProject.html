                <h2>User Research</h2>
                <h3> User Interviews</h3>
                <a  href="https://drive.google.com/open?id=0B4aPgk0woaX7eER5SkN0eHNoVDg"><img class ="UR" src="resources/img/UserIntMin.jpg"></a>
                <p class="about-me">
                    For my user interviews I asked a variety people who are in computer science as well as outside the field of study. The questions were fairly general and gave some insight on personal motivations, how they overcome their personal obstacles and general consensus on what should be in a portfolio website. I believe this approach gave me a better sense of what is generally expected on a more broad sense. Although I can see some negative effects of interviewing this way since this is targeting a specific audience. 
                </p>

                <h3> Competitor Analysis</h3>
                <a  href="https://drive.google.com/open?id=0B4aPgk0woaX7d2t6N0pDeW5FSlE"><img class ="UR" src="resources/img/CompAnalysisMin.jpg"></a>
                <p class="about-me">
                    The competitor analysis was very helpful, personally I'm not a very artistic person or creative so looking at other portfolios were very helpful. My approach was to choose profiles that are very different styles. Then to proceed and draw a mockup of what I believe would be a good design drawing inspiration from the competitors I chose. 
                </p>

                <h3> Feature Value Matrix</h3>
                <a  href="https://drive.google.com/open?id=0B4aPgk0woaX7ckxmODdmNkxnTms"><img class ="UR" src="resources/img/FeatValMin.jpg"></a>
                <p class="about-me">
                    The feature value matrix provided a good symbolic road map of what to prioritize through numeric values in the design of the website. The matrix allowed for easy visibility what should be the main points of design and which would draw the most value for users visiting the website page. My feature value matrix contained sections should be displayed on the webpage as well as technical features that should be included such as css, JavaScript, multi-device support.</p>

                <h3> Feature Prioritization</h3>
                <a  href="https://drive.google.com/open?id=0B4aPgk0woaX7dk5kZG1scjVISDg"><img class ="UR" src="resources/img/FeatPriorMin.jpg"></a>
                <p class="about-me">
                    My strategy of prioritizing features was to place content higher in terms of priority than technical aspect. The rationale of this approach was that, at the very least delivering relevant content to the user is more important than struggling with technical tasks.In hindsight judging by how my website turned out, I actually completed more technical aspects and see higher value in the technical aspects that I have originally given it in the feature priotization.</p>



                <h2>User Testing</h2>


                <h3> User Stories</h3>
                <a  href="https://drive.google.com/open?id=1k7hNdNl56EnMWniTi_OpLZ6lgbuzJ8pI"><img class ="UR" src="resources/img/UserStoryMin.jpg"></a>
                <p class="about-me">
                    The user stories forced me to take a step back and evaluate my portfolio as an outside user. It made me think how potentially a hiring manager, front end developer, phone users and tablet users were viewing my content and if it was delivering the experience I was expecting.</p>

                <h3> Cognitive Walkthrough</h3>
                 <a  href="https://drive.google.com/open?id=1k7hNdNl56EnMWniTi_OpLZ6lgbuzJ8pI"><img class ="UR" src="resources/img/CogMin.jpg"></a>
                <p class="about-me">
                   During the cognitive walkthrough I asked a series of questions to users navigating my website. I asked them basic questions concerning navigation, the purpose of the website, about the author etc. It was particularly useful because you get outside perspective and criticism on aspects of the website I thought was designed well.
                   </p>

                <h3> User Test</h3>
                    <a  href="https://drive.google.com/open?id=1k7hNdNl56EnMWniTi_OpLZ6lgbuzJ8pI"><img class ="UR" src="resources/img/userTestMin.jpg"></a>
                <p class="about-me">
                   For user testing I had two tests one 5 second test and a click test. The 5 second test was a very generalized what do you think the purpose of the website is and what’s the most prominent element on the page. Surprisingly  I got answers I didn’t think would such as “lack of details” even though a simple design was the intended goal. My second test the click test asked where would you click to find out about the author. The results were rather revealing but still predictable, navigation was generally straight forward except that some people chose to click timeline which was not a behavior I intending for.</p>

                <h2> Summary of Findings</h2>
                  <p class="about-me">
                  After completing user research I found that my website did deliver mainly what I had intended. During my cognitive walk through I did have an interviewee say although your portfolio does achieve the intent set out to complete the site are lacked a projects section that would have been helpful to see. I also found that through user research that my about section and timeline are being viewed similarly. But I attribute this to the extremely general question I asked during the user test. In future design I will ensure that the user test are much more specific to yield more useful results.</p>

                <h2> Incorporations of Findings</h2>
                 <p class="about-me">
                 I haven’t incorporated changes from my findings yet but I have noticed and will prioritize one reoccurring thing that was mentioned during my cognitive walkthrough was that there seems to be a performance issue with my webpage. I have been compressing the images I have used in my website in order to give users a better experience when navigating through menu items. Additionally I plan to change out the timeline section completely. Initially I thought it would be a good option in lieu of a project section, but I believe in future iterations I will swap it out for a real project section that will include works that I have completed and collaborated at work and personal projects. I believe optimization of the images as well as cleaning up the content to be more clear on intent will help the portfolio page better serve its purpose.</p>
